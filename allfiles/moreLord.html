                    <p>Many of us go through life trying to rely on our own strength, making our own way, and searching
                        for meaning. But deep down, there’s an emptiness that nothing in this world can fill. The truth
                        is, we were created for a relationship with Jesus, and without Him, we are lost. Only in Him do
                        we find true life, peace, and purpose.</p>

                    <h1>

                    </h1> <br> <br>
                    <p>Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life.<br> No one comes to the Father except through
                        Me.” (John 14:6)<br>

                        Without Jesus, we are disconnected from the One who gives life.<br> He is not just a good
                        teacher or
                        a wise leader. <br>He is life itself. When we try to live apart from Him,<br> we miss out on the
                        fullness
                        of what we were created for.</p>

                    </h1> <br> <br>
                    <p>The Bible tells us, “And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins.” (Ephesians
                        2:1)
                        <br>
                        Sin separates us from God, leaving us spiritually empty. No matter how much success, love, or
                        comfort we try to fill our lives with, nothing can replace the relationship we were meant to
                        have with Jesus. He came to bring us back to life, to restore what was broken, and to give us a
                        new beginning.

                    </h1> <br> <br>
                    <p>“Whoever has the Son has life; <br> whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.” (1
                        John
                        5:12)
                        <br>
                        Eternal life isn’t just about what happens after we die. <br>It begins the moment we accept
                        Jesus.
                        <br> Life without Him is empty and fleeting, but with Him,<br> we have a hope that lasts
                        forever. He
                        offers us a love that never fades,<br> a purpose that never ends, and a home with Him for
                        eternity.

                    </h1> <br> <br>
                    <p>You don’t have to keep searching, striving, or feeling like something is missing. Jesus is
                        already waiting for you, ready to welcome you with open arms.
                        <br>
                        He says, “Come to Me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew
                        11:28)
                        <br>
                        All He asks is that you open your heart and say yes. When you do, you will find the love, peace,
                        and purpose you’ve been longing for—because we were never meant to live without Him.
                        <br>
                        There is no need to fix yourself before coming to Jesus, He is here to cleanse us and save us
                        from our old way and is waiting to join us on our journey to living like heaven!
